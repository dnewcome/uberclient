the framework/ directory is a place where we can keep generic files such as Display.js and DisplayArray.js.

Initially, we want a place to keep
general Displays that aren't specialized, ie put something like `DynamicDisplayArray' here, but put
`NoteDisplayCollection' under displays/.

Later, other things such as HashArray should go somewhere under this folder.

I put PositionedDisplayArray.js here, we'll see how it works out.
